    "description": "Index  (1-based) of the ATL08 classified signal photon from the start of the ATL03 geolocation segment specified on the ATL08 product at the photon rate in the corresponding parameter, ph_segment_id. This index traces back to specific photon within a 20m segment_id on ATL03.  The unique identifier for tracing each ATL08 signal photon to the corresponding photon record on ATL03 is the segment_id, orbit, cycle, and classed_pc_indx. Orbit and cycle intervals for the granule are found in the /ancillary_data. The timestamp of each orbit transition is found in the /orbit_info group.",
