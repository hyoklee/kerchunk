    "description": "The starting geolocation segment number associated with the data contained within this granule. ICESat granule geographic regions are further refined by geolocation segments. During the geolocation process, a geolocation segment is created approximately every 20m from the start of the orbit to the end.  The geolocation segments help align the ATLAS strong a weak beams and provide a common segment length for the L2 and higher products. The geolocation segment indices differ slightly from orbit-to-orbit because of the irregular shape of the Earth. The geolocation segment indices on ATL01 and ATL02 are only approximate because beams have not been aligned at the time of their creation.",
