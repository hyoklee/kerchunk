    "comment": "Equivalent vertical correction due to ionosphere delay. The reported pixel height, latitude and longitude are computed after adding negative media corrections to uncorrected range along slant-range paths, accounting for the differential delay between the two KaRIn antennas. The equivalent vertical correction is computed by applying obliquity factors to the slant-path correction. Adding the reported correction to the reported pixel height results in the uncorrected pixel height.",
