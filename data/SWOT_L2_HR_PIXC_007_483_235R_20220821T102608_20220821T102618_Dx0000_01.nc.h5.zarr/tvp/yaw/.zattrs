    "comment": "KMSF attitude yaw angle relative to the nadir track. The yaw angle is a right-handed rotation about the nadir (downward) direction. A yaw value of 0 deg indicates that the KMSF +x axis is aligned with the horizontal component of the Earth-relative velocity vector. A yaw value of 180 deg indicates that the spacecraft is in a yaw-flipped state, with the KMSF -x axis aligned with the horizontal component of the Earth-relative velocity vector.",
