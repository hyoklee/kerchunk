    "description": "The time of the last spacecraft orientation change between forward, backward and transitional flight modes, expressed in seconds since the ATLAS SDP GPS Epoch. ICESat-2 is considered to be flying forward when the weak beams are leading the strong beams; and backward when the strong beams are leading the weak beams. ICESat-2 is considered to be in transition while it is maneuvering between the two orientations. Science quality is potentially degraded while in transition mode. The ATLAS Standard Data Products (SDP) epoch offset is defined within /ancillary_data/atlas_sdp_gps_epoch as the number of GPS seconds between the GPS epoch (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z UTC) and the ATLAS SDP epoch. By adding the offset contained within atlas_sdp_gps_epoch to delta time parameters, the time in gps_seconds relative to the GPS epoch can be computed.",
