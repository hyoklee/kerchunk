The ATLAS Standard Data Products (SDP) epoch offset is defined within /ancillary_data/atlas_sdp_gps_epoch as the number of GPS seconds between the GPS epoch (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z UTC) and the ATLAS SDP epoch. By adding the offset contained within atlas_sdp_gps_epoch to delta time parameters, the time in gps_seconds relative to the GPS epoch can be computed.",
