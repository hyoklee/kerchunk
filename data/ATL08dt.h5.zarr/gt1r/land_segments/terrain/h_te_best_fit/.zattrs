    "description": "The best fit terrain elevation at the the mid-point location of each 100m segment. The mid-segment terrain elevation is determined by selecting the best of three fits- linear, 3rd order and 4th order polynomials - to the terrain photons and interpolating the elevation at the mid-point location of the 100 m segment. For the linear fit, a slope correction and weighting is applied to each ground photon based on the distance to the slope height at the center of the segment.",
