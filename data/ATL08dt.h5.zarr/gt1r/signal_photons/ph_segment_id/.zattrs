The unique identifier for tracing each ATL08 signal photon to the photon on ATL03 is the segment_id, orbit, and classed_pc_indx. The unique identifier for tracing each ATL08 signal photon to the corresponding photon record on ATL03 is the segment_id, orbit, cycle, and classed_pc_indx. Orbit and cycle intervals for the granule are found in the /ancillary_data. The timestamp of each orbit transition is found in the /orbit_info group.",
