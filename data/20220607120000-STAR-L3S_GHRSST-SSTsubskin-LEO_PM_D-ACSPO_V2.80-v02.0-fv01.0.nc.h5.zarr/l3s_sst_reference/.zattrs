    "comment": "Reference SST used for determining weights of L3U pixels to the L3S output. It is a 7x7 sliding window weighted mean of sea_surface_temperature. Weights are equal to sst_count with a maximum weight of 5. Coverage is improved compared to sea_surface_temperature, at the cost of reduced feature resolution. This is an experimental variable and is subject to change.",
